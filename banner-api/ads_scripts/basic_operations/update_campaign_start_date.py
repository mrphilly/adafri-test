"""This example updates a campaign by setting its status to PAUSED.

To get campaigns, run get_campaigns.py.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.
